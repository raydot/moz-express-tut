    p The library has the following record counts:

    ul
        li #[strong Books:] !{data.book_count}
        li #[strong Copies:] !{data.book_instance_count}
        li #[strong Copies available:] !{data.book_instance_available_count}
        li #[strong Authors:] !{data.author_count}
        li #[strong Genres:] !{data.genre_count}

    // The view is straightforward.  We extend the layout.pug base template, overriding the block
    //  named 'content'.  The first h1 heading will be excaped text for the title variable that was
    // passed into the render() function--note the use of the 'h1=' so that the following text is
    // treated as a Javascript expression.  We then include a paragraph introducing the local library.
